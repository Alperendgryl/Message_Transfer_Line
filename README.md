# Message-Transfer-Line
Each student in a line can pass a message (a string) to any other student after him/her. When a message request arrives to the first student (source), it can pass the message to other two /three students that are placed in the kth position next/previous to him/her. Each non-source student in the message line can only pass the message one step forward/backward. However, if the message arrives at a hub-student, he-she can reset the reach of the message to k students. Hub-students do not extend every message they receive; instead, they extend only the messages they are interested in. They are interested in messages which contain at least 2 letters of their names. If at least 2 letters in the message and their names match, they give a boost to the message, i.e., re-initiate the message line.
